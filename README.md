# jupyter-bootstrap
a jupyter notebook with docker-compose to mirror any files created to local env


To get a jupyter notebook running from your browser, type into the terminal:

$ docker-compose up

Then follow the instructions in your terminal to copy the generated web address and paste it into your browser. Voila! 

This will create a folder called "notebooks" in your project's root directory. Any notebooks you create will be saved to this directory on your local machine.
